## Web App to check which parameter is best using Streamlit 

For the given mushroom dataset, check the accuracy, precision, recall and plot Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve'Precision-Recall Curve for various classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression and Random Forest. This helps to check manually which classifier (among 3) and its corresponding parameter will be suitable for various problem statement.

### About Dataset
From Audobon Society Field Guide; mushrooms described in terms of physical characteristics; classification: poisonous or edible

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
